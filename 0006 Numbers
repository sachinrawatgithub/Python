--There are three numeric types in Python:
int
float
complex
Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:

Example
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

--Int
Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, 
** of unlimited length.
Example
x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522


--Float
Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
Example
x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59


Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
Example
x = 35e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100


--Complex
Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:

Example
x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j

--Type Conversion
You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:
Note: You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.
Example
Convert from one type to another
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

#convert from int to float:
a = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
b = int(y)

#convert from int to complex:
c = complex(x)
d = complex(y)

print(a) 1.0
print(b) 2
print(c) (1+0j)
print(d) (2.80+0j)

--Random Number
Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
Example Import the random module, and display a random number between 1 and 9:

import random
print(random.randrange(1, 10))
