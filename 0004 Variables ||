Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
Example
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

--Unpack a Collection
If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.

Example
Unpack a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


--Global and Local Variable
x = "awesome" #Global Variable

def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic" #Local Variable
  print("Python is " + x) #after every print statement a new line will start

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)

--Output Will Be 
Python is fantastic
Python is awesome
